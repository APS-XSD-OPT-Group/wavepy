Thus far, the experimental values of few tissue types have been reported; these values have been determined from fixated tissue samples. This study presents phase-contrast Hounsfield units for various types of non-fixated human soft tissues. A large variety of tissue specimens ranging from adipose, muscle and connective tissues to liver, kidney and pancreas tissues were imaged by a grating interferometer with a rotating-anode X-ray tube and a photon-counting detector.

However, due to their size and cost, large-scale synchrotrons are not available for more routine applications in small and medium-sized academic or industrial laboratories. This gap could be closed by laser-driven compact synchrotron light sources (CLS), which use an infrared (IR) laser cavity in combination with a small electron storage ring. Hard X-rays are produced through the process of inverse Compton scattering upon the intersection of the electron bunch with the focused laser beam. The produced X-ray beam is intrinsically monochromatic and highly collimated. This makes a CLS well-suited for applications of more advanced-and more challenging--X-ray imaging approaches, such as X-ray multimodal tomography. Here we present, to our knowledge, the first results of a first successful demonstration experiment in which a monochromatic X-ray beam from a CLS was used for multimodal, i.e., phase-, dark-field, and attenuation-contrast, X-ray tomography.

The technique uses a grating-based Talbot-Lau interferometer and was shown to yield image contrast gain, which makes it very interesting to the fields of medical imaging and non-destructive testing, respectively. In addition to X-ray attenuation contrast, the differential phase-contrast and dark-field images provide different structural information about a specimen. For the dark-field even at length scales much smaller than the spatial resolution of the imaging system. Physical interpretation of the dark-field information as present in radiographic and tomographic (CT) images requires a detailed look onto the geometric orientation between specimen and the setup. During phase-stepping the drop in intensity modulation, due to local scattering effects within the specimen is reproduced in the dark-field signal. This signal shows strong dependencies on micro-porosity and micro-fibers if these are numerous enough in the object. Since a grating-interferometer using a common unidirectional line grating is sensitive to X-ray scattering in one plane only, the dark-field image is influenced by the fiber orientations with respect to the grating bars, which can be exploited to obtain anisotropic structural information. With this contribution, we attempt to extend existing models for 2D projections to 3D data by analyzing dark-field contrast tomography of anisotropically structured materials such as carbon fiber reinforced carbon (CFRC).
